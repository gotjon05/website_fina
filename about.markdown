# About Me

I’m an early-career data scientist with four years of experience analyzing membership data using Power BI, managing the SQL/Web server for an E-commerce website, and bridging the gap between non-technical stakeholders and technology. I’m transitioning from seven years of working with nonprofit development using Raisers Edge CRM and overseeing IT infrastructure.
